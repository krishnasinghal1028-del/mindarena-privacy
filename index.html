<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 9, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MindArena</strong> ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Information stored on your device only:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Game progress, high scores, and statistics</li>
    <li>Earned coins, XP level, and daily streak data</li>
    <li>Cosmetic preferences (themes, card styles, glow effects)</li>
    <li>App settings (sound, music, haptic preferences)</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences. It is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

<p><strong>Optional multiplayer features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If you use the Challenge Friends feature, we use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to assign a temporary, randomly generated user ID. No personal information such as your name, email, or phone number is collected.</li>
    <li>Challenge data (game scores and challenge status) is stored in Google Cloud Firestore and is associated only with your anonymous user ID.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App uses the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — to display advertisements. AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address, and ad interaction data to serve relevant ads. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> — for anonymous authentication and cloud data storage in the Challenge Friends feature. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is designed for a general audience and is rated "Everyone". We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since the app uses anonymous authentication only and does not request any personal details, no identifiable information about children is collected.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising</h2>
<p>The App displays banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded video ads through Google AdMob. You can choose to watch rewarded ads to earn in-game coins, but this is entirely optional. Ad networks may use cookies or device identifiers to personalize ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Stored on your device until you uninstall the App or clear app data.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase data:</strong> Challenge records and anonymous user IDs are retained in Firestore. Since no personal information is linked, this data cannot be used to identify you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Local data is stored in your device's private app storage. Cloud data transmitted to Firebase uses industry-standard TLS encryption.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You can delete all local data at any time by uninstalling the App or clearing its data through your device settings. Since we use anonymous authentication, there is no personal account to delete.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
